*Keep in mind*

* I have already made the frame of the dashboard, you guys only have to edit the user controls which are placed inside the folder named UserControls (for example, think you are assigned to do the inventory tab, edit only the UC_Inventory.cs [DESIGN] and UC_Inventory.cs).

* Try to edit only the file which has been assigned to you. (if you think any other file need to be changed please contact me)

* Please do not commit to the main branch, commit to a new branch and please please please name it according to the change you did, it would be so damn easy for me to review your work, otherwise it would be a mess if something goes wrong.
